# üí´ About Me:
I'm currently working on PowerShell scripts for Active Directory management and scripts to automate my future work as a pentester. I'm also serving as a diploma jury member to train the next generation and am responsible for apprentices and interns in IT, providing mentorship related to my role as a systems administrator.<br><br>I'm looking to collaborate on writing and implementing courses for systems administrators to better train future generations in our profession, which I believe is currently too lightly covered in standard training programs.<br><br>I'm looking for help with all the subjects that interest me, but more specifically, I am looking for a mentor for Pentesting/Red Team activities.<br><br>I'm currently learning Pentesting using TryHackMe and Hack the Box.<br><br>Ask me about the profession of systems administration and my overall career path.<br><br>Fun fact: I have always passed my exams and certifications without ever studying.
